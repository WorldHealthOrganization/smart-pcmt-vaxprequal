"""Import WHO Vaccine PreQual data from the backend API.

Downloads paginated results from the PreQual API and generates:
  - FSH logical model instances (FinishedVaccineProducts)
  - FHIR Product and ProductAuthorization instances
  - CodeSystem and ValueSet FSH files

Environment variables:
  PREQUAL_API_ENDPOINT  - API endpoint URL
  PREQUAL_API_USERNAME  - API username
  PREQUAL_API_PASSWORD  - API password

The endpoint is one of the ePQS SOA REST services, e.g.
  https://soauat.who.int/soa-infra/resources/EPQS/QueryFinishedVaccineProducts!1.0/
    RestService_FVP?Query=FinishedVaccineProduct
Pagination parameters are supplied by this script, so any OffSet/Limit
already in the URL is replaced rather than duplicated.  TimeStamp is always
sent, because the service binds it into its SOQL and faults without it.
Each SOA environment has its own password for the EPQSSoa account.
