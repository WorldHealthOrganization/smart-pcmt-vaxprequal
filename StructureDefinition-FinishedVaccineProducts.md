## Logical Model: WHO Vaccine PreQual DB - Finished Vaccine Products

WHO Vaccine PreQual DB - Finished Vaccine Products. Logical model for the WHO PreQual DB as provided by the backend API at: https://extranet.who.int/prequal/vaccines/prequalified-vaccines This model provides authoritative vaccine product IDs and a richer data structure compared to the CSV export. Sub-objects with Identification.Id are modeled as separate logical models and linked via references. 
Key fields from the API (FinishedVaccineProducts): ProductDetails.Identification.Id - Vaccine Product ID (authoritative) ProductDetails.Identification.Name - Product reference name (e.g. FVP-P-447) ProductDetails.Type - Product type code (e.g. Finished Vaccine Product) ProductDetails.DateOfPreQualifiedAcceptance - Date of prequalification ProductDetails.AssessmentProcedure - Assessment procedure code ProductDetails.ApplicantOrganization - Manufacturer/applicant with ID, name, address ProductDetails.Presentation - Presentation form (Vial, Ampoule, etc.) ProductDetails.PharmaceuticalForm - Pharmaceutical form details ProductDetails.DosageDetails.NoOfDosagesPerPrimaryContainer - Number of doses ProductDetails.NRADetails - Responsible NRA with ID, name, address ProductDetails.VaccineDetails - Vaccine type with full, abbreviated, and commercial names ProductDetails.StorageDetails - Storage temperature and shelf life ProductDetails.Status - Prequalification status code 
Cardinality note: Only productId, productName and status are mandatory. Everything else is optional, because the source database de-publishes a product's detail when it leaves prequalified status: the record is retained with its identity, final status and publishing timestamp, and every other field is cleared. Those records are the authoritative history of a past prequalification, so the model has to be able to express them. A small number of currently prequalified products are also missing an individual field where a Salesforce denormalized name was never populated. Do not restore 1..1 on these elements without re-checking the live data; an earlier version of this model asserted that several were always present, which a full extract disproved.
